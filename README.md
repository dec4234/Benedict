# Benedict
Benedict is an extension of the [JavaDestinyAPI](https://github.com/dec4234/JavaDestinyAPI) project I started in August 2020. Its purpose is to facilitate easy access and management of my Destiny 2 clan, Heavenly Mayhem.

My Clan can be found [here](https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2?groupid=3074427)

The general purpose of this discord bot is to facilitate easy management of the clan by granting admins access to commands that automatically sort users by inactivity and other stats.
The bot also permits users to join the clan fully automatically through an [application command](https://github.com/dec4234/Benedict/blob/master/src/main/java/net/dec4234/commands/application/ApplicationCommand.java).
This is immensely helpful because not only does it streamline the application process but it also allows users into the clan at any hour of the day instantly, rather than having to wait for an admin.
